### DESCRIPTION...
This is a notional MERN web project and is meant to be used as a personal example/reference/template/practice. This project is not intended to be launched/hosted. It is, instead, meant to be code-centric.
My goal with this project is to...
* pracice writing features and properly incorporating them into a notional  website
* create a location for referencing feature specific code
* host a git repo that I can use as an example of my fundamental MERN stack understanding
